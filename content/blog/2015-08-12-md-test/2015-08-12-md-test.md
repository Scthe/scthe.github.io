Opening paragraph. Stevenson had long been intrigued by the idea of how personalities can affect a human and how to incorporate the interplay of good and evil into a story. While still a teenager, he developed a script for a play about Deacon Brodie, which he later reworked with the help of W. E. Henley and saw produced for the first time in 1882.

## Normal paragraph

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](https://google.com 'Just a basic test') End.

## Text

Stevenson had long been intrigued by the idea of how personalities can affect a human and how to incorporate the interplay of good and evil into a story. While still a teenager, he developed a script for a play about Deacon Brodie, which he later reworked with the help of W. E. Henley and saw produced for the first time in 1882. In early 1884 he wrote the short story "Markheim", which he revised in 1884 for publication in a Christmas annual. One night in late September or early October 1885, possibly while he was still revising "Markheim," Stevenson had a dream, and upon wakening had the intuition for two or three scenes that would appear in the story.

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

*You **can** combine them*


## Lists

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

## Math ([docs](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/ 'MathJax docs'))

Some math on the same line: $T_n = a + (n-1)d$ ,
  $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$,
  $\mathsf{Data = PCs} \times \mathsf{Loadings}$,
  $\mathbf{X}_{n,p} = \mathbf{A}_{n,k} \mathbf{B}_{k,p}$

Or, some math in a block

$$
T_n = a + (n-1)d
$$


## Code

### Inline

Here is some `inline code` in the middle of sencence


### Code block

Github style:
```javascript
/**
  * A namespace for utility methods.
  */
  util: {
    encode: function encode(tokens) {
      if (tokens instanceof Token) {
        return new Token(tokens.type, encode(tokens.content), tokens.alias);
      } else if (Array.isArray(tokens)) {
        return tokens.map(encode);
      } else {
        return tokens.replace(/&/g, '&amp;').replace(/</g, '&lt;').replace(/\u00a0/g, ' ');
      }
    },
  }
// some comment here!
```

```python
def show
  puts "Outputting a very lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ong lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ong line"
  @widget = Widget(params[:id])
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html # show.html.erb
    format.json { render json: @widget }
    a += 1 # comment
  end
end
